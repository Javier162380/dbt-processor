# dbt-processor

Dealing with the DBT project's dependencies between models could be tricky, especially when a project starts growing and the DBT project ends up with many models. DBT processor is a simple CLI tool that allows you to inspect your DBT dependencies easily, without the need of rendering the documentation.

The project is still in a WIP phase, although all the feedback is more than welcome.
